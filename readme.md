<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
About The Project
This repository contains implementations of fundamental computer vision tasks including image classification, image segmentation, object detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and video classification. It is designed as a learning resource for beginners interested in computer vision and deep learning. The project assumes basic knowledge of deep learning concepts such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and models like YOLO.

Features
Practical examples of core computer vision tasks.
Modular code that can be easily extended or adapted for different projects.
A focus on simplicity and clarity to facilitate learning.
Why Use This Project
Save time by leveraging ready-to-use implementations.
Focus on learning and applying key concepts rather than starting from scratch.
Contribute to and improve this resource, fostering a collaborative learning environment.
No single template can cover all needs, so feel free to suggest improvements or contribute by forking the repo and submitting a pull request.
