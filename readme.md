<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project implements some basic Computer Vision related tasks including image classification, image segmentation, object detection, optical character recognition, video classification. It is helpful for beginners on learning Computer Vision and Deep Learning since it requires the basic knowledge in the field of Deep Learning such as CNN, RNN, Transformer, YOLO, ...

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
